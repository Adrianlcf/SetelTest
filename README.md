For the android emulator, device used is - Pixel_2_API_28 with an Android version of "9.0".

One thing to note about the android emulator - for timezone, in order to bypass the Todoist app timezone adjustment pop-up, we got to manually set the time 
from emulator settings to GMT +8 for MYT hours so that the pop up would not be displayed when the mobile test runs.
